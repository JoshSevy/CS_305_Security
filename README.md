# CS_305_Security

### Overview

In this journal assignment, you’ll submit two items to your portfolio. Remember that you’ll submit assignment items (artifacts) to your portfolio in different courses during the Computer Science program. This portfolio allows you to save your learning and show your best work to future employers. You’ll also reflect on the work that you have done on these projects. Reflecting on your work will help you remember details when you review your portfolio in the future.

### Directions

Choose one artifact to add to your GitHub repository for your portfolio for this course. Submit either the completed Artemis Financial Vulnerability Assessment Report or the completed Artemis Financial Practices for Secure Software Report. You created these items in Projects One and Two. These completed documents show your ability to complete a vulnerability assessment and code securely.

Submit one of the artifacts listed above. Then update the README file in your repository and include your answers to each question below. You may choose to write a few sentences in response to each question or combine all your answers in one or two paragraphs. This assignment is graded as pass or fail. You can earn full credit by responding to each of the following questions:

- Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
- What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
- Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
- How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
- How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
- What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
- Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
